# DriveZy
# Ride Sharing Application Similar to Uber/Lyft using AI/ML to predivt the ride fare
Java enterprise web application which is similar to Uber and Lyft ride booking application that allows customer to book Shared or solo ride. We are using ML model to predict increase or decrease for the rider fare 

## Getting Started
•	Download/Clone all files on local system which contains all java, python code and all other project files that requires for project execution  
•	Start Tomcat and MySQL Server  
•	run MySQL Database script for creating Project Database structure on local system  
•	run the fare_api.py using "python fare_api.py" command for starting flask api for getting taxi fare from machine learning model  
•	enter the URL "localhost:/8080/DriveZy" on browser (8080 Tomcat Port)  
•	Follow the screenshots.pdf for exploring project features Prerequisites  

### Prerequisites
•	Java SE (v6 and above)  
•	Python (v2.7 and above)  
•	Tomcat (v8 and above)  
•	MySQL Database server  
•	Anaconda (for Package dependencies)   

## AI/ML Model for Ride fare prediction

•	dataset downloaded from cityofchicago portal  
	dataset name : Transportation Network Providers – Trips  
	dataset link : https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Transportation-Network-Providers-Trips/m6dm-c72p/data
•	Pandas for data processing  
•	Feature Engineering for Data Cleansing   
•	Random Forest Method for Model training and fare predicition  
•	Joblib package for dumping model in ".lzma" format  
•	Flask API for runnning webservice on seperate port  
•	JSON for passing values to Machine learning model and getting fare prediction using FLASK API
